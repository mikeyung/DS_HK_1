# Can Internet Memes be Modeled as Genes?

## Objective/Abstract: 

Richard Dawkins likened Internet memes to genes, and this study is to show just how accurate that analogy is.

## Hypothesis: 

A meme is an idea that is readily transmitted from person to person. But we humans are not perfect transmitters. While sometimes we repeat the idea exactly, often we change the meme, either unintentionally, or to **embellish** or **improve** it.

So can memes really be modeled as genes ? How would one test the hypothesis that memes undergo a process akin to biological evolution? 


## Style: 

Who was the audience of the paper, and how could that get figured out? (Some data science papers are not written for other data scientists, but more targeted towards the applied section of the paper, ie Sociologists, etc).

## Methods: 

Yule model and Gini Coefficient

## Conclusions: 

Overall assessment of the paper. This is generally broken into parts of what you thought about the material you read, do you think it was well written or poorly written, how well did it answer the questions it was looking at, and did you have any follow up questions about the data, methodologies, etc.
